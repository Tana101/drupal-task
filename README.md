# drupal-task

This Drupal 7 project was created to match the Open Charity design



## Project Highlights
- I made use regions by adding them to page elements that seemed to be modular, in their existence and context.
- I tried to add as much detail as I could see.
- I enjoyed working on this site, because it allowed me to create my own CSS framework. This project also allowed me to demonstrate what I can do with SASS (i.e. some of the functionalities such as the mobile menu, were built with pure CSS and no JS).
- The *layout file* holds both site structure SASS and site style SASS (they were joint into the layout file, because of bespoke nature of the task's requirements i.e. a custom CSS framework)
- I used Gulp + SASS to create my preprocessed CSS and minified JS.
- My stylesheets lean significantly, towards the SMACSS methodology.


## Unique Features
- I made the layout as responsive, as I possibly could (ideally, most devices should work with the styling).
- The mobile menu operates with simple CSS and no JS.
- The round elements and unique components are all running on CSS elements (I avoided using images where I could to improve the HTML structure and reduce page load times).
- The grid system that begins on line 53 of the *layout file* was interesting + fun to build, yet challenging (please review). It was the main highlight of this project, in my opinion.
- I implemented many reusable components (mixin_s, include_s, etc. and tried to utilize the advantages of SASS as much as I could).

- The Geek Label (bonus) website also uses many of the reusable components indicated in the statement above.
